# John ODonnell - Project Portfolio

## Index:

This is a repository to organize and share my personal data science projects! 

1. [Scraping Oil Production Data from Web and Storing the Results in a RDBS](https://github.com/johnyo/PersonalProjects)
    - [Python](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Persohhhnal%20Programming%20Projects/Python)
      - Data Science
      - Scripts
      - Software Development

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation. 

## Background

Howdy! 

My name is John ODonnell and I would like to briefly introduce myself! I earned my B.S. in geoscience from Texas A&M, afterwhich I went on to pursue my M.S. in petroleum geoscience from the University of Texas Arlington. One semester in, I decided to diversify my skillset and pursue my MBA from the University of Texas Dallas. Upon graduation I started on as a geoscientist at a Houston based oil and gas company. It was during this time I was introduced and began to pursue data science, incorporating this valuable new skillset into my work. I used Python for data analysis, data visualization, and have built countless machine learning models which I plan to share with you here! I am now committed full-time to Data Science and building my skillset and this project portfolio! 

Most of my projects will be using datasets from the Oil and Gas domain, as this is where my domain expertise is currently the strongest. My hope is to explain these projects and concepts in a way that is clear and exciting.
